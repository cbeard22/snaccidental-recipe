# sna# snaccidental-recipe
Snaccidental Recipe is a web application that generates recipes based off of search criteria. 

[Live Site!--->](https://dillon-smith-us.github.io/snaccidental-recipe/)

## Description
- The creation of this project was motivated by wanting to create a site for users to find recipes based off of ingredients that they currently have. This application is targeted mainly towards people who are wanting to immerse themselves more in cooking and continue to learn. 
- We built this project to help others expound upon their cooking abilities. With a search function that allows users to check boxes for ingredients they are familiar with or already have, they are able to continually learn more and more and be exposed to recipies and possibilities they may not have seen otherwise. 
- Cooking at home saves money and is generally healthier than eating out at restaurants. Learning to prepare food is an integral life skill and also a fun hobby. 
- In working on this project, we learned how to use modals, resolve Git conflics, furthered our knowledge of API implementation, trimming console outputs for search functions.
